TODO bugs:

1) when you click an autocorrect list item, state is not updated in the modal. For example, if you type in
"chicke" and then click the suggestion that says "chicken", the modal will say "chicke" when you
click submit, even though the textbox says "chicken". When you submit, the fridge will also say "chicke".
The database stores it as "chicken" though and when you click away from the page and return it will
say "chicken" in the fridge, so I think it has to do with asynchronous state

2) the trim function is preventing valid ingredients with two words from being found.

3) (for andres to handle) get list of suggestions to dissappear when textbox is empty

4) not urgent, but submit button placement jumps around depending on suggestions
