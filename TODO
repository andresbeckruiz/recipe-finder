TODO bugs:

1) fridge items not deleting in backend
2) when you click an autocorrect list item, state is not updated in the modal (it submits properly though
and shows up in the fridge as what you clickded). For example, if you type in "chicke" and then click
the suggestion that says "chicken", the modal will say "chicke" when you click submit, even though the
textbox says "chicken". When you submit, the fridge will properly say "chicken".
