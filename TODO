// DEMO: one user with a bunch of data (Andres, Georgia)

TODO bugs:

1) autocorrect parser preventing valid ingredients with two words from being found.
 eg: almond extract (Andres)

2) if user is logged in, and you do npm start and ./run -gui (after not having run in a
while), fridge wont show; not sure how big a deal this is

3) rating ingredients bug (Georgia, Jacob)
